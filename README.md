# MultiTool

### Goal:
- Android Mobile Application for time management - tailor made to my preferences and wants from such an app.
- As of right now, this includes the following:
    - A calendar page where I can create blocks of time for various activities (free time, studying, creative pursuits, projects, etc.)
    - A To-Do list that integrates with the calendar, allowing me to schedule certain items in certain blocks, as well as mark items complete when finished
        - I additionally want functionality for weekly/daily tasks that refresh after a given period of time.
    - A timer/stopwatch that allows me to keep track of how much time ive spent on a particular activity and take timed breaks whenever it becomes necessary.

### Design:
- The design of the app will be created by me (Nebil)
- Color palette will either change depending on which task is active, or just be shades of blue and grey/white.

### Future Steps:
- I want to create a desktop version as well as set up a backend server to sync up both devices.
