# MultiTool
Create a LIGHTWEIGHT and very basic shell of an application that can be modularized and added/detracted from depending on my needs.

The application itself is just an empty screen, but the idea behind it is that new additions can be coded into it very easily, and it is very lightweight.

These additions will not be a part of my project, but the means of adding to the application will be documented and easy to access.
